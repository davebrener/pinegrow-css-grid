Summer Nights, Fragrant Pines

By Barry Forestlight

Pines are special. They're some of the oldest leaving beings on Earth. Did you know some Pine trees are more than 5000 years old - and still growing today?

We organize unique journeys throughout the world, visiting Pine trees on the way. No mountain is too high for us, no desert too dusty, no snow storm too cold. Our motto is: If Pine trees can survive there, so can we!

Once we reach Pine trees at our destination, the real adventure begins. We camp next to the trees for days, sometimes weeks, observing every minute details of their exciting lives. In return we gain insights into their long history, daily life and habits - and into our own lives.

The quote:

We love Pine trees! They're beautiful, strong and they smell great.
